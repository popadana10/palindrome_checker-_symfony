# Palindrome Checker App

This is a simple Palindrome Checker app built using Symfony 7. The application allows users to input a word or phrase and checks if the input is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

## Features

- Check if a word or phrase is a palindrome.
- Clean and retro-inspired user interface.
- Built using Symfony 7 with Twig for rendering the view.

## Usage

- Enter a word or phrase in the input field.
- Click on the "Check" button.
- The app will display whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Project Structure

- `src/Controller/PalindromeController.php`: Contains the logic to check if the input is a palindrome.
- `templates/palindrome/index.html.twig`: The Twig template used for rendering the form and displaying the result.

## Task Information

- This project is part of the Symfony course under the mentorship of **Santosh Kalwar**.
